# Task-3 : Library Management System ( using OOP)

## Objective:
I developed a simple Library Management System using Java, following Object-Oriented Programming principles. This system allows users to add books, register users, issue and return books, and display records 

## Tools Used:
- Java (JDK)
- VS Code
- Terminal
- 
## Features:
- Add new books to the library
- Register new users
- Display list of all books and users
- Issue a book (only if book available)
- Return a book (only if issued)
- Exit the system

## Files Included:
- Book.java --> to define book details
- User.java --> to define user details
- Library.java --> Core logic for managing books and users
- Main.java --> main class with user menu.

## Steps I Followed:
- I created separate classes for Book, User, and Library to organize the code in a modular way.
- Used ArrayLists to store books and users dynamically.
- Implemented methods in the Library class for adding books/users, issuing, and returning books.
- Designed the Main class to provide a menu-based system using Scanner and switch-case.
- Added conditions to check if a book is already issued or not available when issuing/returning.
